# Git to manage 'versions' of files

Similar to 'track-changes' in Microsoft Word, Git keeps track of any edits and makes it possible to track who made the change and when.  Git is most commonly used to manage collaboratively edited code, but it can keep track of any file. 

# Version Control

## Tracking changes with version control 

**Payoffs**

- Eases collaboration
- Can track changes in any file type (ideally plain text)
- Can revert file to any point in its tracked history

**Costs**

- Learning curve

## Environment for reproducible research   {.columns-2}

<img src="07_assets/rstudio.png" alt="alt text" width="10%">

* integrated R console
* deep support for markdown and git
* package development tools, etc. etc.

> RStudio 'projects' make version control & document preparation simple


## Depositing code and data

**Payoffs**
- Free space for hosting (and paid options)
- Assignment of persistent DOIs
- Tracking citation metrics 

**Costs**
- Sometimes license restrictions (CC-BY & CC0)
- Limited or no private storage space

## A hierarchy of reproducibility 

- **Good**: Use code with an integrated development environment (IDE). Minimize pointing and clicking (RStudio)
- **Better**: Use version control. Help yourself keep track of changes, fix bugs and improve project management (RStudio & Git & GitHub or BitBucket)
- **Best**: Use embedded narrative and code to explicitly link code, text and data, save yourself time, save reviewers time, improve your code. (RStudio & Git & GitHub or BitBucket & rmarkdown & knitr & data repository)

#  Git Tutorial: let's get started
<!-- <img src="11_assets/git.png" alt="alt text" width="30%"> -->

 The 3 states of files: Staged, Modified, Committed
<img src="11_assets/staging.png" alt="alt text" width="75%">

The important stuff is hidden in the `.git` folder (which might be hidden on your computer)

## Github

> GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It provides several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. <small> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub> Wikipedia </a> </small>

You can think of GitHub as part:

* Server to back up your files
* Website to share your files
* Method to track changes to your files
* Platform to collaboratively develop code (or other files)

### Example: this course website is managed using Git & GitHub

<a href=https://github.com/adammwilson/RDataScience/tree/gh-pages> <img src="11_assets/githubcoursewebsite.png" alt="alt text" width="100%"></a>


## Install Git on your computer

### Windows and OSX
http://git-scm.com/downloads

### Linux
` sudo apt-get install git `
or similar


## Creating an account on [GitHub](github.com)

1. Create a GitHub account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
    * This will be a public account associated with your name
    * Choose a username wisely for future use
    * Don't worry about details, you can fill them in later
2. Create a repository called _demo_
    * Add a brief and informative description
    * Choose "Public"
    * Check the box for "Initialize this repository with a README"
3. Click "Create Repository"


## In RStudio: `clone` the repository

1. Go to RStudio
    * File -> New Project
    * Version Control: Checkout a project from a version control repository
    * Git: Clone a project from a repository
2. Fill in the info:
    * URL: use HTTPS address
    * Create as a subdirectory of: Browse and create a new folder called `GEO503` (or similar)

To set up a connection that doesn't require you to type in your password every time, [see here](GitSSHNotes.html)    

## Commit to GitHub from within RStudio

### Steps:

1. Edit: make changes to a file in the repository you cloned above
2. Stage: tell git which changes you want to commit
3. Commit (with a message)
4. Push: send the updated files to GitHub

## Staging
<img src="11_assets/Stage.png" alt="alt text" width="75%">

Select which changed  files (added, deleted, or edited) you want to commit.

## Committing
<img src="11_assets/Commit.png" alt="alt text" width="100%">

Add a _commit message_ and click commit.

## Syncing (`push`)
<img src="11_assets/Push.png" alt="alt text" width="100%">

Click the green arrow to sync with GitHub.

## Git File Lifecycle

<img src="11_assets/Lifecycle.png" alt="alt text" width="100%">


## Git command line from RStudio

RStudio has limited functionality.  

<img src="11_assets/CommandLine.png" alt="alt text" width="75%">


## Git help

```{}
$ git help <verb>
$ git <verb> --help
$ man git-<verb>
```
For example, you can get the manpage help for the config command by running `git help config`

## Git status
<img src="11_assets/GitCL.png" alt="alt text" width="75%">

Similar to info in git tab in RStudio

## Git config
`git config` shows you all the git configuration settings:

* `user.email`
* `remote.origin.url`  (e.g. to connect to GitHub)

## Branching
Branches used to develop features isolated from each other. 
<img src="11_assets/merge.png" alt="alt text" width="100%">

Default: _master_ branch. Use other branches for development/collaboration and merge them back upon completion.

## Basic Branching

```{}
$ git checkout -b devel   # create new branch and switch to it


$ git checkout master  #switch back to master
$ git merge devel  #merge in changes from devel branch
```
But we won't do much with branching in this course...

## Git can do far more!

Check out the (free) book [ProGIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

<img src="11_assets/progit2.png" alt="alt text" width="30%">


Or the [cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

## Philosphy  
Remember, the data and code are _real_, the products (tables, figures) are ephemeral...  


## Git and RMarkdown

### Visualize .md on GitHub

Update the YAML header to keep the markdown file

From this:
```{r, eval=F}
title: "Untitled"
author: "Adam M. Wilson"
output: html_document
```

To this:
```{r, eval=F}
title: "Demo"
author: "Adam M. Wilson"
output: 
  html_document:
      keep_md: true
```

And click `knit HTML` to generate the output

## Visualize example
<img src="11_assets/ghmd.png" alt="alt text" width="50%">


### Explore markdown<->Git

1. Use _File -> New File -> R Markdown_ to create a new markdown file.  
2. Use the Cheatsheet to add sections (`#` and `##`) and some example narrative.  
3. `Stage`, `Commit`, `Push`!
4. Make more changes then `Stage`, `Commit`, `Push`!
4. Explore the markdown file on your GitHub website.

## Git Jargon
<img src="11_assets/git.png" alt="alt text" width="30%">

* **Strong support for non-linear development:** Rapid branching and merging,  specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history. 
* **Distributed development:** No central server needed, each user has a full copy
* **Efficient handling of large projects:** Designed to manage the Linux OS
* **Cryptographic authentication of history:** The ID of a particular version depends upon the complete history. Once published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed.
